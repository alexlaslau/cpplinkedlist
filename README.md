# cpplinkedlist

I created a <b>C++ Linked List Data Structure</b> from Scratch.

It's nothing complicated, the file from the YT Video can be accessed at singlylinkedlist.cpp.

I've also created a Doubly Linked List for those who need it. (doublylinkedlist.cpp)

It has two classes, one representing the Node Class (Which holds the data and the pointer to the next node) and the LinkedList Class (obviously)
